### Context
CSS is the simply put the foundation for decorating and changeing your code into what you would like it to look like. It allows you to change color, location, shade, and even more!

### What Ive learned so far
CSS is how you change your code to look like how you want it to be and with that ive learned things like `<color>` or `background` that change its respective element when you want. So far although not crucial to the code it does help add alot of visual appeal to your code and it may add a better viewing experience.






### Challenge 
Although not the major of a element one of my challenges was that of the location between border, margin, and padding orginally I had thought it was the element following that would be the element following that would be border then margin and finally padding for example while playing around in jsbin and messing around I had gotten slightly confused as I had wanted the element followed by the border into margin and then padding.

```css
div {
  width: 300px;
  border: 15px solid green;
  margin: 20px solid red;
  padding: 50px solid red;

}
```
However after a little bit of tinkering with the visuals of js bin and the colors to match the elements of border margin and padding I had come to a better understanding of the three where it was padding then border and finally margin.
