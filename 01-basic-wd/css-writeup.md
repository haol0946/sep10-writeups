### Context
CSS is the foundation for decorating and changeing your code into what you would like it to look like. It allows you to change color, location, shade, and even more!

### What Ive learned so far
CSS is how you change your code to look like how you want it to be and with that ive learned things like `<color>` or `background` that change its respective element when you want. So far although not crucial to the code it does help add alot of visual appeal to your code and it may add a better viewing experience.
