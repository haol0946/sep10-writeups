## Course: SEP 10
## Period: 6
## Concept: AVD


### Context
AVD or advanced web design is broken apart into 5 sub catagories that being Basics, Colors, Positioning, Geometry, and Amimation. With these 5 catagories you can customize and decorate your website while advancing from simple to hard. 
### What Ive learned so far
Although we werent made to do all of the lessons on FCC for each of the 5 catagories we did focus on one main topic and then learned the other 4 topics through our peers though 


### Challenge 1 : Positioning
Originally while looking at the different types of positioning (i.e Fixed, relative, absolute, etc) I found it slightly confusing as to what each of them did and why with some more confusing than others.


### Challenge 2 : Animation 
Since this was my main topic and I had the opportunity to work with the code it was far less confusing than the topic of positioning therefore I only had one challenge and that was the code for `css
`<animation-fill-mode>`
