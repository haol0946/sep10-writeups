## Concept: HTML


### Context 
HTML is the shorted way of saying hyper text markup language and in sense it is the skeleton for text in a browser or whatever you will use it for. The goal in html was just to set a base for our code and what we will use fot our freedom project through out the year. 
I.E
HTML = What shows up be it images, texts, or links

### What ive learned in HTML
So far in the first unit we've strictly been learning HTML and its code for example using <img> to insert images to the page or using <li> for lists so on and so forth. However to learn all to this we've mainly using a couple things like freecodecamp or just paying attention during the class.
