## Concept: HTML


### Context 
HTML is the shorted way of saying hyper text markup language and in sense it is the skeleton for text in a browser or whatever you will use it for. The goal in html was just to set a base for our code and what we will use fot our freedom project through out the year. 
I.E
HTML = What shows up be it images, texts, or links

### What ive learned in HTML
So far in the first unit we've strictly been learning HTML and its code for example using `<img>` to insert images to the page or using `<li>` for lists so on and so forth. However to learn all to this we've mainly using a couple things like freecodecamp or just paying attention during the class.


### Challenges 
The challenges ive faced so far were mainly funny ones as the solutions were generally right infront of my face the whole time and I wouldn't have struggled if I had paid attention and read the instructions on FCC. For example one challenge I had orignally was adding values to the Radio Buttons and Checkboxes. For example in FCC it would give you this line of code to add a value too each button or checkbox
```
    <label for="indoor" > <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" > Indoor</label>

    <label for="outdoor"><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" > Outdoor</label><br>

    <label for="loving"><input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>

    <label for="lazy"><input id="lazy" type="checkbox" name="personality"> Lazy</label>
```
