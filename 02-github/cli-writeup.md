## Name: Hao Lin
## Course: SEP 10
## Period: 6
## Concept: Command Line

### Context
Command line is a text based interface where you can interact with a computer's operating system with the help of a shell which is directly between the operating system and the user.
### What Ive learned so far
So far in command line we have learned a lot of commands used for command line in which we have mainly used in practice with replits and we eventually will use it with git / github in our IDE's. A piece of code we've learned so far is cd which will move you into a directory or file and with cd .. you can go backwards.

### Challenge #1
The number one challenge ive had in command line by far is remembering the order and difference between git add, commit, and push or remembering the exact code needed for each of the code. For example for git add I would always forget to add the file after git add and for git commit I would almost ways forget to add -m and the message to the end which would always end up to fatal errors. 

So to fix this I would always look back into my notes to remember the correct order and proper code and then I would tinker in replit until I would remember the order.




### Challenge #2
Another challenge I had during command line while although being easier to fix it was still a challenge was trying to remember all the proper code needed for all the classwork and homeworks. So a really simple fix to this was to properly fill out my SEP10 notes sheet and always look back onto it if I ever needed help.


### Some takeaways
* Always keep proper notes
* Always be look back onto notes if you ever need
* Always tinker for anything that I am confused on
