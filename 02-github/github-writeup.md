## Course: SEP 10
## Period: 6
## Concept: Git / Github

### Context
Git is a code tracking system that hundreds of thousands to millions of coders use on a daily basis and on the other hand github is what is used to house the git respositories and contrary to popular belief git is not an actual coding program it just tracks the actual code.

### What ive learned so far in Git/ Github
So far in this unit we've learned a pleathora of new code to use in our IDE's some the most important ones being Git clone which clones the repository into our IDE for use and also git add, commit, and push which are some of the most important pieces of code we've learned so far which allow us to put what we coded in our IDE back into github

### Challenge 1
One of the challenges I had for git is trying to remembering all the code for git and command line to use in my IDE for classworks and homeworks. Although this is not a hard challenge to fix it is a challenge that should be fixed or constantly addressed on. The easiest fix to this would be to always look back on my notes to look for any code that I need however there were sometimes that I didnt have my notes fully updated or I didn't understand the topic enough to fill out my code properly so to fix not having my notes fully updated I would ask my partners, neighbors, or friends for help.

### Challenge 2
A second challenge that I had was properly communicating with my partners or friends enough so that we are on the same page and pushing and pulling the proper things at the proper times in order to not contradict each other and cause a fatal error. The easiest fix to this problem is to just always communicate what pulls or pushes your are doing and at what time. However if me or my partner is not here for the day and we need to work on a project for example if one of us sick or if after the semester we switch classes and need to work on the CYOA we can just communicate either through slack or other means of messaging.


Some take aways
* Always keep on top of notes 
* Ask people for help if needed
* Always always communicate
